Chosen as _Top 5 Projects at SheHacks8+ in London University_, **SafeGuard** is a _safety-focused map application_ that is inspired by the personal experiences of our group members. We shared a common experience of feeling unsafe while traveling alone. 

This React Native application connects to seven API's (including three Google Maps API's and CrimeData API) to allow users to:
1. pin comments when you click on a location, about the safety of the location
2. view crime statistics on zip codes when you long-press on the location
